        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Eat it as a snack, breakfast, hell even dinner or with a glass of craft beer. You do you.</p>
        <p>The following recipe will get you about 2-3 servings.</p>
        <p><strong>Time: </strong>About 30 minutes.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup + 2 tbsp of rice (long, medium, or short grain)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup of water</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp or pinch of salt</li>
            <li>2 cups of milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp of vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add rice and water to a nonstick pan.</li>
            <li>Add salt and stir.</li>
            <li>Cook on medium high heat until it boils.</li>
            <li>Once it boils, turn down the heat to medium low.</li>
            <li>Cover pan with a lid and let it simmer while stirring now and then until rice is soft.</li>
            <li>Once all the water has been absorbed, stir in the milk and sugar and turn up heat to medium.</li>
            <li>Keep stirring until it has thickened. Remember, it will thicken even more as it cools.</li>
            <li>When it starts bubbling a lot, keep stirring to avoid burning on the bottom.</li>
            <li>When it has thickened to like a thick porridge or watery oat meal, turn off the heat and continue to stir.</li>
            <li>Once the bubbles subsde, add in the vanilla extract and stir.</li>
            <li>Let it cool and then serve or pack away.</li>
        </ol>
