        <h5>Delicious Banana Bread!</h5>
        
    <p>Follow this simple recipe for the best banana bread! It uses few ingredients and is so easy to bake. It bakes for about an hour and is quick to mix the ingredients in.</p>
        <p><strong>REMEMBER</strong> to use <em>super ripened</em> bananas to really get the most out of that sweet banana flavor! It's best to use brown or browning bananas. It's much easier to mash them too when they're browning.
    
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <p>Straight to the point and no damn life story!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups AP flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter - melted</li>
            <li>3/4 cups brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>4 bananas (2/3 cups)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 F</li>
            <li>Mix flour, baking soda, and salt into a big mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix the melted butter, brown sugar, and eggs together in a separate bowl.</li>
            <li>Mash the 4 bananas with a fork in a separate bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix the mashed bananas together with the butter, brown sugar, eggs, and whisk.</li>
            <li>Now combine eveyrthing into the big mixing bowl and whisk it all together.</li>
            <li>Butter a baking pan.</li>
            <li>Let it bake about 50-60 minutes. When a toothpick comes out pretty much clean from poking the bread in the middle, it's done!</li>
            <li>Let it cool in the pan for about 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place the load on a wire rack and let it cool for several hours (4-5 hours).</li>
            <li>Make sure the bread has cooled properly before wrapping the bread in plastic or cutting it into slices and placing them in a tupperware container.</li>
